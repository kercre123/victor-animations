This directory contains:
 - a MODIFIED copy of SOME of the Victor scripts that were in https://github.com/anki/victor/tree/master/project/victor/scripts/
 - the rsync.bin and rsyncd.conf files that were in https://github.com/anki/victor/tree/master/tools/rsync/
 - a runtime/ sub-directory that contains an EXACT copy of the Victor runtime scripts that were in https://github.com/anki/victor/tree/master/project/victor/runtime/

^ all from mid-February, shortly BEFORE we switched to DVT2/LE robots
